I'm a minimalist, and that plays a huge role in my day-to-day life.

My room consists of a bed, a wardrobe and a desk. I only own a macbook and a very basic phone. I don't collect things, I don't store boxes of [kipple](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kipple) or old stuff, and I eventually give away everything I don't use often.

I like to live like that, and it helps me to be organized and keep life simple.

But I'm also a minimalist in my digital self.

Since my first time using a computer, more than a decade ago (I barely had any interactions with eletronics before my teen years), I've always hated loose files. While everyone had hundreds of megabytes inside their downloads or desktop folders, mine was always clean. When I got more curious about how computers works and how things manage themselves at low levels, I eventually started navigating through all of my computer directories one by one monthly to delete old or unused files, as well as files left by deleted softwares.

That always felt good to me. The sensation that I can control almost everything my computer stores and keeping it clean and organized felt the same way as cleaning my room or my house.

While working as a software developer, deleting code always felt more pleasurable than writing it. Reducing complexity while maintaning usability and acessibility is wonderful. While the first iteration of an algorithm will usually have a lot of boilerplate code and repetition, taking some time to re-write it (but no to the point of costly purchase my time) makes me a better developer.

One thing for complexity versus simplicity is that sometimes something can be simple but it isn't just for the sake of those who admire complexity or for it to look more legitimate. I've seen a lot these days where stuff comes out as revolutionary throwing fancy words at your face to convince you that their complexity is their triumph - where in fact it will probably lead to their debt and demise.

But there is, of course, a great beauty on some truly complex things. It's left for you to decide which things you will admire for their complexity and those you will love because it's simple.

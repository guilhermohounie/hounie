Have you ever thought "why would anyone use this?" to something popular?

One of my biggest weaknesses is sometimes forgetting that only because I'm not attracted to a product or a concept, it does not mean everyone else thinks like me.

(btw, I'm not really the entrepeneur type of person.)

Being social and understanding the value of stuff for those out there it's a very powerfull skill for anyone, and in programming it plays a very important role when developing UX/UI. You cannot create good software with you don't go out and interact with people, because chances are they are the ones who will use it.

I am, fortunately, good at socializing and feeling empathy towards others. But sometimes, my own thoughts makes me underrate what I don't see value where others see gold, and I see that as a negative thing in the sense that I can be blinded by a unitateral POV.

Maybe, sometimes, it's good to be (and think) like most people.

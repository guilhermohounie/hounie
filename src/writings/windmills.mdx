I'm used to drinking milk almost every night before going to sleep (which I recently learned from a Doctor friend of mine that this is not healthy - but anyway)

My family owns a very large collection of mugs, most of them are “display only”, and the most simple or old ones are the ones we use.

Even though that still makes about 20-30 mugs available, I've been using the same one since I was a kid - A dark blue mug that my dad had even before I was even born.

So every night for more than a decade I sat down at the dinner table and quietly enjoyed my milk, looking at it in silence. But the mug is not only dark blue - It has a bird, the name “Dale Bird” and then the phrase “Interpreting the world.”

After years of looking at the same bird and the same words over and over again, I finally decided to look for its meaning. It was too late at night, so I did not bother my father with it. Instead I just google the name “Dale Bird” hoping for it to be enough for me to uncover it.

Turns out [Dale Bird](http://birdgeo.com/) is a very important and respected person in geophysics (which made sense since my father work on Potential Fields)

Even though I was kinda satisfied with the discover, I felt like I had to tell him that my favorite mug was from a Talk he made 20+ years ago in Houston, and so I reached him from his e-mail.

I won't reveal the details of our cool and brief interaction, but he said something that I carried on with me since then.

In the end of his e-mail, he said.

“Too few Quixotes, too many windmills.”

If you ever read Don quixote, you'll probably understand that - But I had not.

So I went on to read it, in order to understand the meaning of it - and I loved it.

### So what?

Recently I've been fiddling with the ideia that being curious is one of the most important steps to happiness, and the connections we make along the journey of curiosity will forever change the way we perceive the world. I just love the cascade effect from learning about the origins of a mug to reading one of the most influential books in history.

Keep curious, and enjoy the ride.

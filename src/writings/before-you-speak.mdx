My 2022 new year's resolution list had only one bullet point in it.

I was going to start doing everything in my life slower; Take my time and pace when doing things. (I suffer from anxiety and ADHD btw.)

It was a little hard at first, due to the fact that I have anxiety and sometimes doing things slowly does not help against it.

I started with simple and daily tasks, like choosing an outfit or cleaning my room. I would walk slowly and move gently, while trying to mentally focus on what I'm doing and why and how. Perceiving every movement, moment and putting my efforts on one action at a time. If I had to carry two bags from one place to another, I would make two travels.

Nowadays, I can pretty much do all of my tasks that way while not wasting time and also enjoying the process of it. Instead of acting like an automated human, I do things and I appreciate the course of them.

There are of course some days in which I cannot do this for a number of reasons possible, but when I can, I feel great.

But the most important skill and habit I learned with this was to take my time before talking. Usually, we end up saying things we don't really mean because we so often don't really stop to think and realize what we want to say truthly.

So the first thing I say before answering an important question or talking about something sensitive is "Let me think about the right words." and really do it.

It may sound silly, but this has helped me a lot and also made me a more eloquent person. By doing so, I have evaded a lot of miscommunication issues in my sometimes overly-dramatic life, but no only that, as I also remember more correctly the things I said and why I said it.

Think before you speak.
